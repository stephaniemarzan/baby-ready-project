# Baby Ready Application

## Intender User
This app is targeted at expectant parents who want to keep their thoughts and to-do's in order ahead of the baby's arrival. 

### Purpose
An account in Baby Ready will allow expectant parents to have access to create a to-do list and a shopping list. Both lists will be easily editable, allowing parents to edit the input text, delete items, or mark items as completed. The shopping list will have an additional feature that will allow parents to shorten links for shopping pages and easily copy them into an input field where they can add text next to it to differentiate the links. This app will help them have their affairs in order before the baby's arrival.

## PHP Version
7.4.21

## How to Start Application Locally
To start the application locally you will need to clone the Github Repository [linked here](https://github.com/stephaniemarzan/baby-ready-project). After you have cloned the repository to your computer, you need to make sure you have a local server like MAMP available. If not, please install a local server environment. Once you have your local server, enter the details in the file database.php. This will allow you to test the application on your local server. Make sure you have the correct tables created in your database in order for the information to be sent correctly. It is important that a foreign key is used for the user id so that the correct information is displayed to the user. Once you have made the necessary changes, make sure you revert the database.php file to the web hosted database.
